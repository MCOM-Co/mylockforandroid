# Basic #
Just skips through lockscreen so you don't have to slide to unlock, but also no need to worry about pocket unlock since side buttons will remain locked.

# Guarded #

  * Security mode - The lockscreen shows first. When exited, the normal unlock screen appears. Can be used with or without pattern security, however pattern mode is recommended to reduce redundancy.
  * Guarded mode - The lockscreen is only awakened by power key, slider open, or keypad buttons. Replaces the lockscreen without re-defining lock behavior.

# Advanced #
  * Advanced mode - The lockscreen can wake up with any key. Instant unlock or advanced lockdown can optionally be set up for any key. Optional advanced power save mode sets a quicker timeout when the lockscreen is awakened.

The guarded and advanced replacement lockscreens are capable of widget customization
Launch **Personalize Lockscreen** to set the widgets you want. This will allow any of the modes to display your widgets after easy setup. Need to change the widgets? Just choose reset from the menu.

Every version has the Security timer feature which allows users to set a number of minutes after which the pattern mode will engage. Ensure you have set a pattern first, myLock automatically suppresses it and engages the timer so the security screen is not in your face every time.

All versions will also contain a 1x1 widget toggle button and option of whether to lock during calls.

_myLock Lite - to be redone as pre 2.0 compatibility, no persistent mode. Goal is to get the phone handling perfect and utilize original alpha 2c secure exit at every wakeup_
