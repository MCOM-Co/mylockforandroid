# Locale Integration #

Locale security plug in features the abiltiy to have myLock start up or securely shut down with locale conditions. In addition you can set a timeout mode where if myLock is running it will then close securely if the phone is left idle (asleep) long enough while the conditions are still met.

# Wallpaper lockscreen with auto unlock logic #
This is a separate mode users can turn on with the auto dismiss version.
It is essentially a cosmetic wallpaper only lockscreen replacement that still auto unlocks
Some users complain that they still see the lockscreen. It is overall a better experience for these users to see wallpaper and perhaps a small message (or progress bar) saying it is unlocking. The current implementation shows a first message while the system is performing any wakeup operations, then changes to a message while the CPU is taking time to recall the last screen.
